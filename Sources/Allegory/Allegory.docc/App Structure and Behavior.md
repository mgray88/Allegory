# App Structure and Behavior

Define the entry point and top-level organization of your app.

## Overview

Declare your app by creating a structure that conforms to the ``App`` protocol and add one or more scenes to it. You can use built-in scenes, like ``WindowGroup``, or you can compose custom scenes that conform to the ``Scene`` protocol. Scenes contain the view hierarchies that define the user interface of your app, and have a life cycle that the system manages.
