/// A 2D shape that you can use when drawing a view.
///
/// Shapes without an explicit fill or stroke get a default fill based on the
/// foreground color.
///
/// You can define shapes in relation to an implicit frame of reference, such as
/// the natural size of the view that contains it. Alternatively, you can define
/// shapes in terms of absolute coordinates.
public protocol Shape: View, SomeShape {
    /// Trims this shape by a fractional amount based on its representation as a
    /// path.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - startFraction: The fraction of the way through drawing this shape
    ///     where drawing starts.
    ///   - endFraction: The fraction of the way through drawing this shape
    ///     where drawing ends.
    /// - Returns: A shape built by capturing a portion of this shapeâ€™s path.
